# Available parameters and their default values for the Consul chart.
# Server, when enabled, configures a server cluster to run. This should
# be disabled if you plan on connecting to a Consul cluster external to
# the Kube cluster.
server:
  replicas: 1
  bootstrapExpect: 1 # Should <= replicas count

  # storage and storageClass are the settings for configuring stateful
  # storage for the server pods. storage should be set to the disk size of
  # the attached volume. storageClass is the class of storage which defaults
  # to null (the Kube cluster will pick the default).
  storage: 64Mi
  # storageClass: local-path

# Client, when enabled, configures Consul clients to run on every node
# within the Kube cluster. The current deployment model follows a traditional
# DC where a single agent is deployed per node.
client:
  enabled: true

  # grpc should be set to true if the gRPC listener should be enabled.
  # This should be set to true if connectInject or meshGateway is enabled.
  grpc: true

ui:
  # True if you want to enable the Consul UI. The UI will run only
  # on the server nodes. This makes UI access via the service below (if
  # enabled) predictable rather than "any node" if you're running Consul
  # clients as well.
  enabled: true

  # True if you want to create a Service entry for the Consul UI.
  #
  # serviceType can be used to control the type of service created. For
  # example, setting this to "LoadBalancer" will create an external load
  # balancer (for supported K8S installations) to access the UI.
  service:
    enabled: true
    type: 'LoadBalancer'

# ConnectInject will enable the automatic Connect sidecar injector.
connectInject:
  enabled: true
  default: false  # true will inject by default, otherwise requires annotation

  # Requires Consul v1.5+ and consul-k8s v0.8.1+
  centralConfig:
    enabled: "true"

    # defaultProtocol allows you to specify a convenience default protocol if
    # most of your services are of the same protocol type. The individual annotation
    # on any given pod will override this value. A protocol must be provided,
    # either through this setting or individual annotation, for a service to be
    # registered correctly. Valid values are "http", "http2", "grpc" and "tcp".
    defaultProtocol: "http"

    # Specify a container which has Envoy and any referenced filters
